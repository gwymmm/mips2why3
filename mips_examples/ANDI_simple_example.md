# ANDI Simple Example

## Description

We compute (1 AND 1) and expect the result to be True ($t1 = 1)

## Result

All assertions can be proved in Why3 (using Z3, longer timeout).

Execution of the code in MARS finishes successfully. 

Final value of the $t0 register: 0x 1.

Final value of the $t1 register: 0x 1.

# Verification of MIPS Assembly Code in Why3

This project investigates how theorem provers (especially provers from the SMT family) can assist in the verifcation of assembly programs. The main idea is to translate annotated MIPS assembly programs to the Why3 verification platform. Then proof can be done with automated provers.

\textit{
Reliable software is important for modern technologies. Mathematics
(formal methods) can help to improve software quality. One particular
method is based on programming by contract. First a program is 
annotated with contracts. In a second step the contracts are proven to 
hold for this program. For some languages tools already exist that 
support this procedure and it would be advantageous to have similar 
tools for assembly languages. Why3 can be used to write this kind of
tool. Why3 is a verification platform that provides a programming 
language (WhyML) together with a specification language. The aim of this
work is to write a model of the MIPS instruction set in Why3 and a 
program that translates annotated MIPS assembly to WhyML. Finally MIPS 
assembly can be analyzed using Why3.
